# Query Specialization Algorithm Implemented in Prolog SWI

This folder contains supplementary material for our paper submission.

Specifically, it includes two Prolog files:

* An example of the encoded input for our running example (input.pl)
* The specialization algorithm (main.pl)

  
Instructions on how to 1) encode an input or 2) run the specialization algorithm can be found in the comments within the code.
